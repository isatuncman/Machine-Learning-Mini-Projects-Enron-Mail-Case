Udacity Intro to Machine Learning Mini Projects
==============

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms using  
scikit-learn library of Python. This project is a part of Introduction to Machine  
Learning class of Udacity Nano-Degree Program.

## Dataset

and clean and provided by Udacity. Furthermore, the starter codes were also given
by Udacity.

## Methods
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Regression and  
Decision Tree Algorithms were conducted.
