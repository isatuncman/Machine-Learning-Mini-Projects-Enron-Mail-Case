Udacity Intro to Machine Learning Mini Projects
==============

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms using  
scikit-learn library of Python.
This project is a part of Introduction to Machine  
Learning class of Udacity Nano-Degree Program.

## Dataset
The famous enron email dataset was utilized for this project. The dataset was tidy  and clean and provided by Udacity. I have performed all feature selection, new feature creation, feature scaling, model development and model evaluation process.

## Methods
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Regression and  Decision Tree Algorithms were conducted.  
In final project:  
SelectKBest feature selection method was used to select feature.   
MinMaxScaler was used to scale features.  
Pipelines were created to develop the model.  
GridSearchCV was utilized for parameter tuning.  
StratifiedShuffleSplit validation method was used to evaluate the model.
